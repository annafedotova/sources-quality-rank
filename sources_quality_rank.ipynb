    "# Sources Quality Rank\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to build a recommendation system to detect the best traffic sources (apps or websites) where a specific app in question can be promoted. An online advertising company X has a lot of historical information for a big number of apps that they promoted, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- App vertical of the promoted app (Games, Shopping, Transportation, etc.)\n",
    "- Country where the app was promoted\n",
    "- Operating System of the app\n",
    "- All traffic sources that were used to promote the app\n",
    "- What were the results of promotion in terms of volumes (number of conversions) and traffic quality\n",
    "\n",
    "As a proxy for traffic quality the following metrics are used:\n",
    "\n",
    "- KPI reach (how good was the traffic source in terms of reaching client's objective for the campaign)\n",
    "- Fraud Index (how likely the conversions brought by the traffic source are fraudulent, based on a third-party fraud detection tool)\n",
    "- Early Conversions (how many installs are coming within the first 2 hours after the click which is considered to be normal user behaviour). This will be used to calculate ClickSpam Index, which is another fraud indicator not accounted for by Fraud Index.\n",
    "\n",
    "**KPI Reach** \n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the Client, each app will have a different KPI goal, which can be formulated in one of the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Percentage**: out of all acquired users, how many do you expect to convert to a specific in-app event (for example, first ride)\n",
    "\n",
    "*For example, if your KPI goal for converting from install to first ride is 20%, you expect at least 20 out of 100 users who installed the app to book a first ride with your taxi app. If a specific traffic source generated 100 installs, and only 10 users booked a first ride, the Percentage of this source is 10%, and therefore they only reached 50% of your goal (KPI Reach = 50%).*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CPE (Cost per Event)**: what is the maximum amount you are willing to pay for a user who converted to a specific in-app event (for example, first ride)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Let's say you are running a CPI user acquisition campaign where you pay 1 USD for each acquired user. But you are mostly interested in users who book a first ride in your app, and you are willing to pay no more than 4 USD per paying user (i.e. user who booked a first ride). So if a traffic source generates 100 installs (100 USD cost for you) and out of those 25 users book a first ride, your CPE (cost per first ride event) would be 100 USD / 25 = 4 USD exactly equal to your KPI (KPI Reach = 100%).\n",
    "If more users booked a first ride, the CPE would be lower, and therefore the KPI goal would be overreached. On the contrary, if less users booked a first ride, each paying user would have costed you more than 4 USD, and therefore your KPI goal would not be reached.*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ROI (Return on Investment)**: what return on investment you expect for a specific campaign\n",
    "\n",
    "*ROI = Revenue / Cost, where revenue is all the amount spent by the acquired users in your app, and Cost is how much you spent on user acquisition. So if you acquired 100 users paying 1 USD for each install (your cost is 100 USD), and those users made several purchases that resulted in a total spend of 120 USD, your ROI is 120%.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: all the names, such as sourceName, country, OS, app vertical were randomly generated and assigned."

    "- earlyConversions: how many conversions happened within the first 2 hours after the click\n",
    "- kpiGoalReach: what % of client's goal was reached\n",

    "- Kpis : this table contains the KPI goal configured for each promotional campaign (lineId)\n",
    "- Events : this table contains tha amount of all post-install events that happened on a specific campaign after the user installed the app\n",
    "- Fraud : this table contains Fraud Index assigned to each combination of the specified dimensions by the third-party fraud detection tool\n",
    "\n",
